## The Quiz-Service Architecture
### The Core and the Interface

**The Core**

- The Core is responsible for all theÂ **business logic**Â within the system. It encapsulates the core functionality and domain-specific rules.
- We draw inspiration from the concept ofÂ **Bounded Contexts**Â in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Each context represents a dedicated module that groups related business logic.
- For instance, consider the following contexts in our project:
    - **Quiz Context**: Manages quiz sessions and user answers
    - **Score Context**: Evaluate user answers, calculates and updates user scores.
- The Core exposes functions that the Interface can use to serve external client requests.
- Crucially, the Core focuses solely on business logic and remains agnostic about how clients access our system (whether through REST, MVC, GraphQL, etc.). This responsibility lies with the Interface.
- In the project structure, you can find the core at: `src/core`

**The Interface**

- The Interface is responsible forÂ **exposing system functionalities**Â to external clients.
- When a request arrives, the Interface receives it along with input data. It then converts this input into a well-typed structure required by the Core.
- The Interface performs two critical tasks:
    1. **Validation**: Ensures that input adheres to expected type and format.
    2. **Normalization**: Converts possibly weakly-typed input into a consistent type.
- Note that this normalization is distinct from business validation, which remains the Coreâ€™s responsibility.
- In the project structure, you can find the interface at: `src/api`
    

Engineers benefit from understanding the distinct roles of each part. When exploring system behavior, developers can delve directly into the Core, ignoring routing specifics, decoding/encoding intricacies, and HTTP error codes.

Conversely, making changes to the Interfaceâ€”such as supporting a new protocol (e.g., adding GraphQL alongside an existing REST API)â€”requires no knowledge of the Coreâ€™s internals.

By maintaining this clear separation, we ensure high code quality and facilitate efficient development. ðŸš€
